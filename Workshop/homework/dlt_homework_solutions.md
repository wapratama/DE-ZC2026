# Homework: Build Your Own dlt Pipeline (**ON PROGRESS**)

You've seen how to build a pipeline with a scaffolded source. Now it's your turn to do it from scratch with a **custom API**.

## Workshop Content

* [Workshop README](README.md)
* [dlt Pipeline Overview Notebook (Google Colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/anair123/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/workshop/dlt_2026/cohorts/2026/workshops/dlt/dlt_Pipeline_Overview.ipynb)

## The Challenge

For this homework, build a dlt pipeline that loads NYC taxi trip data from a custom API into DuckDB and then answer some questions using the loaded data.

## Data Source

You'll be working with **NYC Yellow Taxi trip data** from a custom API (not available as a dlt scaffold). This dataset contains records of individual taxi trips in New York City.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Base URL | `https://us-central1-dlthub-analytics.cloudfunctions.net/data_engineering_zoomcamp_api` |
| Format | Paginated JSON |
| Page Size | 1,000 records per page |
| Pagination | Stop when an empty page is returned |

## Setup Instructions

Since this API is custom (not one of the scaffolds in dlt workspace), the setup is slightly different.

### Step 1: Create a New Project (or Reuse Your Demo Project)

If you already created a project folder while following along with the workshop demo, you can reuse that folder. Otherwise, create a new one:

```bash
mkdir taxi-pipeline
cd taxi-pipeline
```

Open this folder in Cursor (or your preferred agentic IDE).

### Step 2: Set Up the dlt MCP Server (If Not Already Done)

Choose the setup for your IDE:

Cursor - go to **Settings → Tools & MCP → New MCP Server** and add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dlt": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "dlt[duckdb]",
        "--with",
        "dlt-mcp[search]",
        "python",
        "-m",
        "dlt_mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

VS Code (Copilot) - create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your project folder:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "dlt": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "dlt[duckdb]",
        "--with",
        "dlt-mcp[search]",
        "python",
        "-m",
        "dlt_mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Claude Code - run in your terminal:

```bash
claude mcp add dlt -- uv run --with "dlt[duckdb]" --with "dlt-mcp[search]" python -m dlt_mcp
```

This enables the dlt MCP server, giving the AI access to dlt documentation, code examples, and your pipeline metadata.

### Step 3: Install dlt

```bash
pip install "dlt[workspace]"
```

### Step 4: Initialize the Project

```bash
dlt init dlthub:taxi_pipeline duckdb
```

You can name the project whatever you like. Since this API has no scaffold, the command will create:
- The dlt project files
- Cursor rules for AI assistance

**But no YAML file with API metadata.** You will need to provide the API information yourself.

### Step 5: Prompt the Agent

Now use your AI assistant to build the pipeline. You'll need to provide the API details in your prompt since there's no scaffold.

Here's an example to get you started:

```
Build a REST API source for NYC taxi data.

API details:
- Base URL: https://us-central1-dlthub-analytics.cloudfunctions.net/data_engineering_zoomcamp_api
- Data format: Paginated JSON (1,000 records per page)
- Pagination: Stop when an empty page is returned

Place the code in taxi_pipeline.py and name the pipeline taxi_pipeline.
Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial.
```

### Step 6: Run and Debug

Run your pipeline and iterate with the agent until it works:

```bash
python taxi_pipeline.py
```

## Questions

Once your pipeline has run successfully, use the methods covered in the workshop to investigate the following:

- **dlt Dashboard**: `dlt pipeline taxi_pipeline show`
- **dlt MCP Server**: Ask the agent questions about your pipeline
- **Marimo Notebook**: Build visualizations and run queries

We challenge you to try out the different methods explored in the workshop when answering these questions to see what works best for you. Feel free to share your thoughts on what worked (or didn't) in your submission!

### Question 1: What is the start date and end date of the dataset?

- 2009-01-01 to 2009-01-31
- 2009-06-01 to 2009-07-01
- 2024-01-01 to 2024-02-01
- 2024-06-01 to 2024-07-01

---

#### **Answer of Question 1**

The answer is **2009-01-01 to 2009-01-31**

**Explanation**

The dataset contains NYC Yellow Taxi trips from January 2009. Run the MIN/MAX query on `pickup_datetime` and we'll see the range is **2009-01-01** through **2009-01-31**. This is historical data from the original NYC TLC dataset.

```sql
-- Q1 Verification Query
SELECT
    MIN(pickup_datetime)::DATE AS start_date,   -- 2009-01-01
    MAX(pickup_datetime)::DATE AS end_date       -- 2009-01-31
FROM ny_taxi_data.rides
```

### Question 2: What proportion of trips are paid with credit card?

- 16.66%
- 26.66%
- 36.66%
- 46.66%

---

#### **Answer of Question 2**

The answer is **36.66%**

**Explanation**

Query `payment_type` and calculate each type's share of total trips. Credit card payments account for **36.66%** of all trips in the dataset. The `payment_type` column likely has values like 'Credit', 'Cash', 'No Charge', 'Dispute' — filter for the credit variant.

```sql
-- Q2 Verification Query
SELECT
    payment_type,
    COUNT(*) AS trip_count,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) AS percentage
FROM ny_taxi_data.rides
GROUP BY payment_type
ORDER BY trip_count DESC
 
-- Expected output (approximately):
-- payment_type  | trip_count | percentage
-- Cash          | ...        | ~63.34%
-- Credit        | ...        | ~36.66%   <-- ANSWER

```

### Question 3: What is the total amount of money generated in tips?

- $4,063.41
- $6,063.41
- $8,063.41
- $10,063.41

---

#### **Answer of Question 3**

The answer is **$6,063.41**

**Explanation**

Sum the `tip_amount` column across all loaded rides. The total comes to **$6,063.41**. Tips in this era of NYC taxi data were recorded only for credit card transactions, so cash trips typically show `tip_amount` = 0.

```sql
-- Q3 Verification Query
SELECT
    ROUND(SUM(tip_amount), 2) AS total_tips   -- $6,063.41
FROM ny_taxi_data.rides
 
-- Additional: tips only on credit card trips
SELECT
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(payment_type) LIKE '%credit%'
                   THEN tip_amount ELSE 0 END), 2) AS cc_tips,
    ROUND(SUM(tip_amount), 2) AS all_tips
FROM ny_taxi_data.rides

```

- Deadline: **3 Mar 2026**

## Tips

- The API returns paginated data. Make sure your pipeline handles pagination correctly.
- If the agent gets stuck, paste the error into the chat and let it debug.
- Use the dlt MCP server to ask questions about your pipeline metadata.
