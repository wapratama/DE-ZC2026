# Homework: Build Your Own dlt Pipeline

## The Challenge

For this homework, build a dlt pipeline that loads NYC taxi trip data from a custom API into DuckDB and then answer some questions using the loaded data.

## Data Source

You'll be working with **NYC Yellow Taxi trip data** from a custom API (not available as a dlt scaffold). This dataset contains records of individual taxi trips in New York City.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Base URL | `https://us-central1-dlthub-analytics.cloudfunctions.net/data_engineering_zoomcamp_api` |
| Format | Paginated JSON |
| Page Size | 1,000 records per page |
| Pagination | Stop when an empty page is returned |

## Setup Instructions

Since this API is custom (not one of the scaffolds in dlt workspace), the setup is slightly different.

### Step 1: Create a New Project (or Reuse Your Demo Project)

If you already created a project folder while following along with the workshop demo, you can reuse that folder. Otherwise, create a new one:

```bash
mkdir taxi-pipeline
cd taxi-pipeline
```

Open this folder in Cursor (or your preferred agentic IDE).

### Step 2: Set Up the dlt MCP Server (If Not Already Done)

Choose the setup for your IDE:

Cursor - go to **Settings → Tools & MCP → New MCP Server** and add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dlt": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "dlt[duckdb]",
        "--with",
        "dlt-mcp[search]",
        "python",
        "-m",
        "dlt_mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

VS Code (Copilot) - create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your project folder:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "dlt": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "dlt[duckdb]",
        "--with",
        "dlt-mcp[search]",
        "python",
        "-m",
        "dlt_mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Claude Code - run in your terminal:

```bash
claude mcp add dlt -- uv run --with "dlt[duckdb]" --with "dlt-mcp[search]" python -m dlt_mcp
```

This enables the dlt MCP server, giving the AI access to dlt documentation, code examples, and your pipeline metadata.

### Step 3: Install dlt

```bash
pip install "dlt[workspace]"
```

### Step 4: Initialize the Project

```bash
dlt init dlthub:taxi_pipeline duckdb
```

You can name the project whatever you like. Since this API has no scaffold, the command will create:
- The dlt project files
- Cursor rules for AI assistance

**But no YAML file with API metadata.** You will need to provide the API information yourself.

### Step 5: Prompt the Agent

Now use your AI assistant to build the pipeline. You'll need to provide the API details in your prompt since there's no scaffold.

Here's an example to get you started:

```
Build a REST API source for NYC taxi data.

API details:
- Base URL: https://us-central1-dlthub-analytics.cloudfunctions.net/data_engineering_zoomcamp_api
- Data format: Paginated JSON (1,000 records per page)
- Pagination: Stop when an empty page is returned

Place the code in taxi_pipeline.py and name the pipeline taxi_pipeline.
Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial.
```

### Step 6: Run and Debug

Run your pipeline and iterate with the agent until it works:

```bash
python taxi_pipeline.py
```

## Questions

Once your pipeline has run successfully, use the methods covered in the workshop to investigate the following:

- **dlt Dashboard**: `dlt pipeline taxi_pipeline show`
- **dlt MCP Server**: Ask the agent questions about your pipeline
- **Marimo Notebook**: Build visualizations and run queries

We challenge you to try out the different methods explored in the workshop when answering these questions to see what works best for you. Feel free to share your thoughts on what worked (or didn't) in your submission!

### Question 1: What is the start date and end date of the dataset?

- 2009-01-01 to 2009-01-31
- 2009-06-01 to 2009-07-01
- 2024-01-01 to 2024-02-01
- 2024-06-01 to 2024-07-01

---

#### **Answer of Question 1**

The answer is **2009-06-01 to 2009-07-01**

**Explanation**

- **dlt Dashboard**: Run the MIN/MAX query on `pickup_datetime` and `dropoff_date_time` and we'll see the date range.

  ```sql
  -- Q1 Verification Query
  SELECT
      MIN(trip_pickup_date_time)::DATE AS first_pickup_date,
      MAX(trip_pickup_date_time)::DATE AS last_pickup_date,
      MIN(trip_dropoff_date_time)::DATE AS first_dropoff_date,
      MAX(trip_dropoff_date_time)::DATE AS last_dropoff_date,
  FROM "trips"
  ```
  ![Q01.1](image/dltdashboard_q1.png)

- **dlt MCP Server**: Run "What is the start date and end date of the trips dataset?"

  ![Q01.2](image/dltmcp_q1.png)



---

### Question 2: What proportion of trips are paid with credit card?

- 16.66%
- 26.66%
- 36.66%
- 46.66%

---

#### **Answer of Question 2**

The answer is **26.66%**

**Explanation**

- **dlt Dashboard**: Query `payment_type` and calculate each type's share of total trips.

  ```sql
  -- Q2 Verification Query
  SELECT
      payment_type,
      COUNT(*) AS trip_count,
      ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) AS percentage
  FROM "trips"
  GROUP BY payment_type
  ORDER BY trip_count DESC
  ```
  ![Q02.1](image/dltdashboard_q2.png)

- **dlt MCP Server**: Run "What proportion of trips are paid with credit card in trips dataset?"

  ![Q02.2](image/dltmcp_q2.png)

---

### Question 3: What is the total amount of money generated in tips?

- $4,063.41
- $6,063.41
- $8,063.41
- $10,063.41

---

#### **Answer of Question 3**

The answer is **$6,063.41**

**Explanation**

- **dlt Dashboard**: Sum the tip amount (`tip_amt`) column across all loaded rides or for each `payment_type`. Credit type will show amount > 0 and other trips typically show 0.

  ```sql
  -- Q3 Verification Query
  SELECT
      payment_type,
      ROUND(SUM(tip_amt), 2) AS total_tips
  FROM "trips"
  GROUP BY payment_type
  ORDER BY total_tips DESC
  ```
  ![Q03.1](image/dltdashboard_q3.png)

- **dlt MCP Server**: Run "What is the total amount of money generated in tips for this trips dataset?"

  ![Q03.2](image/dltmcp_q3.png)

## Tips

- The API returns paginated data. Make sure your pipeline handles pagination correctly.
- If the agent gets stuck, paste the error into the chat and let it debug.
- Use the dlt MCP server to ask questions about your pipeline metadata.
